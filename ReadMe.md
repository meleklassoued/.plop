# Plop Component Generator

This is a [Yeoman generator](https://yeoman.io/) that creates a new React component file for your application. The generator prompts the user for the component type and name and generates a component file with a template.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies
3. Run `npm run plop` to start the Plop CLI and create a new component file
